I am a third-year PhD student whose research spans Large Language Models(LLMs), reinforcement learning, and constrained optimization. I develop methods for preference-based fine-tuning and safe policy learning, with an emphasis on reference-aware training, constraint satisfaction, and sample-efficient optimization. My recent projects explore reliable alignment objectives for LLMs and primal–dual or mirror-descent approaches for constrained decision-making, seeking both strong empirical performance and provable guarantees. Ultimately, I aim to bridge theory and practice to make foundation models more robust, controllable, and trustworthy.
